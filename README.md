# Dictionary
<?php = shorthand for <?php echo $a; ?>
Declare = used to set execution directives for a block of code.
Abstract class = the parent's class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these methods must be 
 defined with the same visibility
public = class property.
public user = calls user or creates one.
int = integers
Final Class = which keeps child classes from abrogating a strategy by prefixing the definition with last. On the off 
 chance that the class itself is being characterized last, at that point it can't be expanded.
return = returns program control to the calling module.
Extends = the subclass inherits all of the public and protected methods from the parent class.
Void = void as their return type must either omit their return statement altogether, or use an empty return statement.
New = adds new name.
$this =  is available when a method is called from within an object context.
::class = You don't have to store your class names in strings anymore. So, many IDEs can retrieve these class names 
 when you refactor your code.
AsertInstanceOf() = Reports an error.
AssertClassHasAttribute = Asserts that a class has a specified attribute.
AssertTrue = In PHPUnit, assertTrue and assertFalse are type-dependent, strict checks. assertTrue($x) checks whether TRUE 
 === $x, it is the same as assertSame(TRUE, $x), and not the same as assertEquals(TRUE, $x).
AssertEquals = Checks that two variables are equal. If you’re comparing floating-point values, you can specify the 
 optional “delta” parameter which dictates how great of a precision error are you willing to tolerate in order to
 consider the two values equal.
